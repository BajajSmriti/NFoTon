# Contributing

Below we have listed a few ways to contribute on NFoTon:
* Finding a bug and reporting it by creating an issue;
* Discussing on issues comments to better solve the problem;
* Self-assigning an issue and creating a pull request;

_Note:_ before creating an issue, make sure that's not a duplicate.


## How to contribute
* First of all, create a fork from [our project](https://github.com/FotonTech/NFoTon) to make your updates;
* For every update you must create a new branch and send a pull request to main repository's `develop` branch;
* All of your commits must be based on [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)'s good practices guide;
* Make sure your code follows the already used pattern;
